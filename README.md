# K-means-Clustering-Image-Compression
This project implements image compression using the K-Means clustering algorithm in C, enhanced with OpenMP for parallel processing. The program compresses images by reducing the number of unique colors to K clusters, improving performance by utilizing multiple threads. It also measures and logs the execution time for different thread counts.
